                The Top 7 Most Common Internet Threats
              <br>
            
             
      
            </h3>
            <div class="no1">Trojan</div>
            <div class="common">Trojans leave your computer completely unprotected, which can mean that hackers can steal any data from your system.
                <br> Trojans often present themselves as harmless computer programmes so that hackers can penetrate your computer without being detected.</div>
              <br>     

              <div class="no2">Virus</div>
            <div class="common">One of the most talked about internet threats is a virus. Viruses usually attach themselves covertly to downloads as they are
                <br> designed to spread at an alarming rate. Viruses are often attached to files for download, shared via CDs, DVDs, and USB sticks, or loaded on to computers by opening infected email attachments.</div>
              <br>

              <div class="no4">Worm</div>
            <div class="common">Worms usually make their way on to a computer via a malicious email attachment or USB stick. Once your computer has been infected by a worm, 
                <br>it will likely send itself to every email address logged in your system. To the receiver, your email will appear harmless, until they open it and are infected by the same worm.</div>
              <br>

              <div class="no5">Phishing</div>
            <div class="common">In its simplest terms, phishing is a form of fraudulent activity. More often than not, official-looking emails are sent impersonating a well-known provider, such as a bank.
                <br> These emails are sent to acquire peopleâ€™s passwords and credit card details.</div>
              <br>

              <div class="no6">Spyware</div>
            <div class="common">Another form of malware is spyware. Spyware is an all-encompassing internet nasty and is usually attached to pop-ups of downloadable files. Once installed on your computer, spyware can 
                <br>monitor your keystrokes, read and delete your files, reformat your hard drive, and access your applications. Whoever is controlling the spyware has access to your personal details without you even knowing.</div>
              <br>

              <div class="no7">Pharming</div>
            <div class="common">Pharming is a more complex version of phishing that exploits the DNS system. Pharmers often create web pages mimicking that of a trustworthy business, such as an online banking log-in page. 
                <br>Users will then enter their details, thinking they are logging in to their usual service, and their details will be stolen by the pharmer.</div>
